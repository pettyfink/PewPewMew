Never a player:
    Idle, maybe patrol. Manage needs like low energy, reload (scavenge for ammo?)

Player in area:
    If player viewable, alert
    attack player

Player left area:
    Start forget_timer
    Until forget_timer stops:
        If sensor_raycast can see player:
                Change state to CHASE
                (Turn to face player with sensor_raycast)
        Else:
                Walk to last_target.origin
                If colliding with StaticBody:
                    Move away by relative X

Forget_timer stops:
    Look around
    Change state to IDLE
