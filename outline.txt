Keep it as basic as possible

- Half-Life-ish movement
    * WASD
    * Jump
    * Crouch
- Weapons
    * Melee
    * bat
    * pistol
    * dual pistols
    * shotgun
    * smg
    * rifle 
- Weapon system
    * Pickups
    * Unique ammo
- Anywhere kick (tail?) like in Duke Nukem
- Basic NPC AI
    * Hear player sounds
    * See player
    * When > 20% health, attack player and follow
    * When < 20% health, maintain distance, strafe and attack
- Basic enemy types 
    * Pistol
    * Low health Shotgun
    * High damage melee
    * High health Shotgun + 100dmg Melee
- Basic level
    * Starting point
    * Ending point (button/switch like Doom/Duke/Wolfenstein)
    * Pickups
    * Surprise
    * Secret (climb to get something cool? follow laser pointer through wall?)
    * Obstacle to exit (key, button to raise bridge, damage wall, etc.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas after first phase
- Add stunting
    * a simple WASD dive
    * WASD roll (double tap crouch)
- Environment interaction
    * Breakables [glass, boxes, etc.]
    * Pushables [boxes, office chairs, things to use for cover, etc.]
    * Useless interactables (press E to play with yarn ball)
    * Doors
    * Elevators
- Super basic cars? Is it possible?
